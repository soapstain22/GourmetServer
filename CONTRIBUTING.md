<h1>Editing the server</h1>
<p>hi i would really like you to help me with the server one way or another, we have a whole page of issues located (here) [https://github.com/soapstain22/GourmetServer/issues]</p>
<h2>How to make changes</h2>
<p>Make changes to the server by creating a fork</p>
<p>A fork is your clone of the server that can be used as a workspace for changes</p>
<p>Any changes you make on this fork will be reflected in the server, after you create a pull request</p>
<p>A pull request will commit your changes onto the master repository after the next time it fetches from the repo (reboot)</p>
