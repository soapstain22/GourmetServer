## also big header text because just letting you know that this server is designed to accept connections from clients with no access to a copy of minecraft. if you have a computer of any kind, play on that rather than on your switch/xbox/phone because 1.20.2 just came out on java and nothing is updated so we have to use 1.20.1. if you want to play on a computer but dont have minecraft installed please download a cracked launcher. legacylauncher or tlauncher will work. also please get people to join this server. i like it when people are on it.
