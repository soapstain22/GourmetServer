## How to edit
First you gotta create a fork of this repository. Forks are just copies of a repository that you can edit, and anything you type in there will be mirrored onto the server. when you are done making changes, create a pull request that merges your changes from your fork into soapstain22/GourmetServer/master. If your pull request is nice and follows guidelines i will accept it and it will be added into the server automagically.

This looks really complicated but all you have to do is create your own fork of the server by using the button at the top of the github page. just make changes on your fork and create a pull request and it will be in the server. Google is your friend with this process, so if you dont get something just look it up or ask on the discord

## How to Run you own server
- Linux: Run the following command in the root directory
```
bash run.sh
```
after this, the server should fetch the latest changes from the repo and will run on java port 25565, and bedrock port 19132. ports are set up right out of the box, so if people cant connect to your version of the server its almost 100% because of a port forwarding issue.
