config-version: 1.2.7
# WARNING: Do not change this value as this might end up in a plugin that does not work!!
#----------------------------------------------Language-------------------------------------------------

# Here you can change the language of the plugin.
language-file: lang-en.yml

# See this link for all available language files: https://gpplugins.gitbook.io/economyshopgui/file-configuration/languages#currently-supported-languages


#-----------------------------------------------Locale--------------------------------------------------

# The locale which will be used to format currencies.
# Examples:
# 'en-US' has a format of '#,##0.00'
# 'nl-NL' has a format of '#.##0,00'
locale: en-US

# Currency format
currency-format: '#,##0.00'

# Note: This is not the locale at which messages will be translated, see the above option for that.
# The locale is set in BCP 47 language tag.
# See this website for some example BCP 47 language tag you can use: https://appmakers.dev/bcp-47-language-codes-list/


#-----------------------------------------------Updates-------------------------------------------------

# This option enables or disables the automatic checking of updates for the plugin on startup or reload of the plugin
update-checking: true


#----------------------------------------------DebugMode------------------------------------------------

# Set this value to false to disable debug mode and do not send debug messages to the console.
debug: true

# When this option is true, nms will be used for item loading and opening shops
use-nms: true
# The benefit of using NMS is that test results prove that it is almost twice as fast for loading items/opening shops
# The plugin is always tested using NMS and so you should not need to disable this option
# The only reason why you would want to disable this is if you're experiencing version compatibility issues or if support tells you to do so


#---------------------------------------------Transactions----------------------------------------------

# Whether transactions should be logged to a text file
transaction-log: true


#---------------------------------------DisabledCommandsInWorlds----------------------------------------

# The setting below enables or disables the disabled commands inside certain worlds feature
# When this option is true, the commands that are added to the world inside the list below will be disabled
enable-disabled-worlds: false

# List of commands with disabled worlds
# Each command has its own list of worlds that will be disabled.
# If a command is not added or the list with worlds for the specified command is empty,
# the command will work in every world.
disabled-worlds-per-command:
    shop:
    - 'testbuilding'
    sellall:
    - 'randompvp'
    editshop:
    - 'boss-fights'
    - 'Survival-Spawn'

# NOTE: Commands disabled inside worlds with the feature above will still be registered inside the server,
# meaning that a command still can conflict with the same command from another plugin.


#--------------------------------------------EconomyProvider--------------------------------------------

# Use this to set a different economy provider other than vault
# Economy types:
# VAULT = Economy API which requires a separate economy plugin to be installed like Essentials or CMI
# PLAYER_POINTS = Economy provider which supports MySQL
# GEMS_ECONOMY = Economy provider which supports multiple currencies using 'GEMS_ECONOMY:<currency>'
# ULTRA_ECONOMY = Economy provider which supports multiple currencies using 'ULTRA_ECONOMY:<currency>'
# EXP = Raw XP points used to enchant items
economy-provider: VAULT

# The economy provider above will be used for every item except when you specify a specific section economy.
# See our wiki here on how to use multiple economy's at the same time for specific sections:
# https://wiki.gpplugins.com/economyshopgui/file-configuration/sections.yml#specific-currency

# The formatted names for currency's
# Any currency's from gems-economy and ultra-economy will use the default currency formats,
# though this can be overridden by setting it manually below per currency if desired
currency-formats:
    player-points:
      singular: Point
      plural: Points
      friendly: Points
    vault:
      singular: '%currency-symbol%'
      plural: '%currency-symbol%'

    gems-economy:Example:
      singular: Example
      plural: Examples
      friendly: Examples


#--------------------------------------------SpawnerProvider--------------------------------------------

# DEFAULT = The default spawner provider inside ESGUI
# SILKSPAWNERS = An external spawner provider created by Timbru(1.18)
# SILKSPAWNERSV2 = An external spawner provider created by CandC_9_12(1.19)
# WILDSTACKER = An external spawner provider that can stack/upgrade spawners
# ULTIMATESTACKER = An external spawner provider that can stack spawners
# ROSESTACKER = An external spawner provider that can stack spawners
# MINEABLESPAWNERS = An external spawner provider
spawner-provider: DEFAULT
# NOTE: When there is no spawner provider set, the default will be used


#-----------------------------------------------DiscordSRV----------------------------------------------

# The DiscordSRV hook allows you to log transaction directly to a discord text channels in your guild when someone makes a transaction
enable-discordsrv-hook: false

# Note: The channel configured under the 'channel' option also needs to exist inside config.yml of DiscordSRV or this won't work
# See their documentation on how to add channels: https://docs.discordsrv.com/installation/basic-setup/#set-up-a-basic-channel-relay

sold-items-ignored-NBTtags:
- 'RepairCost'
# The 'RepairCost' tag is added by default since all items that get repaired by anvil/mending will get it, if we don't add it to the ignored list, a item repaired will not be able to be sold to the server

max-shop-pages: 50
# Note: 50 pages is already a limit of 2250 items(50 * 45) inside one shop section which will most likely never be used.
# We only decided to add a limit to this to prevent people from making a shop with a redundant amount of pages(1000/5000/...),
# if you really need more pages inside your shop which will most likely never happen, just join our support server and tell us why you need it, we will increase this limit only if we see this being a need.

#-----------------------------------------------Commands------------------------------------------------

# When this option is turned on it will automatically override the essential's sell command with an alias to /sellall.
# There are a few reasons why this setting is turned on for default, and you should use /sellall instead of /sell
# 1. EconomyShopGUI's /sellall command is capable of differentiating item meta data whereas the /sell command from essentials sells items according to their material
# 2. Players accidentally use /sell instead of /sellall ending up in giving them a different sell price for the item
override-sell-command: true
# Note: Disabling this feature will get rid of the command alias, but you will need to restart your server to see changes

# This setting will enable the use of the old /sellall command
# Meaning that if the below setting is set to true, players can use '/sellall' without a subcommand to sell the whole inventory instead of '/sellall inventory'
old-sellall-command: false
# This setting is set to false by default because it may confuse players with the /sell command from essentials, ending in them accidentally selling their whole inventory
