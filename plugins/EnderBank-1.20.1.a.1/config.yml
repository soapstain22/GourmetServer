Default_Page_Price: 10
#This is how much the first bank page will cost
Page_Price_Multiplier: 1
#This is how much the bank page cost will be multiplied
#by for every additional page.
Page_Price_Addition: 0
#This is how much the bank page cost will be increased
#by for every additional page.

Use_Item_For_Page_Price: false
#Enable this if you wish to use an item to purchase new pages.
#This does NOT replace cash but works WITH cash. Set cash to 0
#if you only want items for purchase

 2:
  id: "STICK"

#This item "2" is the item required for the second page (first unlocked). Same goes for other pages.

  lore:
   - "&r&7Use me to upgrade your EnderBank page count!"
#This default item is the one that will be looked for if a specific page doesn't
#have an item like how page 1 does above.
#If you wish to cap the EnderBank page counts, simply put specific items for all
#the pages you wish to include, and then make the default item something unobtainable.

Enable_Permission_Mode: false
#If this is enabled, pages still can be bought like before, however they will now
#ALSO require permission nodes. The permission node for players to be able to buy
#pages is: 'enderbank.buypage.#'
#You must add this permission for EACH page # the player is meant to be able to buy.

Maximum_Pages_Allowed: -1
#This is the maximum number of pages a player can buy.
#Set it to -1 for there to be no maximum.

Must_Look_At_Chest_To_Search: true
#This makes it so players must be looking at an EnderChest
#to utilize the search feature, resulting in a "never left
#the chest" experience despite actually exiting their bank
#to enter their search term in the chat.

Enable_Open_Bank_Noise: true
#Enable this to play a noise upon opening a player's bank
#It currently plays every time the first page is opened as this
#is the only way it can work with the way the backend saves
#the inventories and opens other pages.

Open_Bank_Noise: "BLOCK_ENDER_CHEST_OPEN"
#This is the correct name for the noise in 1.15.2
#If you'd like to use a different noise or run a different minecraft
#version, check documentation for exact sound name.

Open_Bank_Noise_Global: true
#If this is true, then the noise made upon opening a players'
#bank will be heard by all nearby players. If false, only
#the player opening the bank will hear it.

#Disabled_Worlds:
#- Default
#- Default_Nether
#- Example3
#This is a list of worlds that the plugin is disabled in.
#To enable this feature, simply uncomment it.

Disable_Dump_Into_Inventory: false
#Setting this to true disables use of the dump buttons.

Dump_Into_Inventory_Blacklist:
 item1randomidentifier:
  id: "COMPASS"
  name: "&cServer Changer"
  lore:
   - "&rRight click to change servers!"
 item2randomidentifier:
  id: "STICK"
#Items on this blacklist will not automatically be carried over into EnderBanks upon clicking the
#dump into inventory buttons. Add server switching compasses, tutorial books, or anything else like that
#you see fit. PROBABLY REMOVE THE VANILLA STICK FROM IT.
